                            Inside the new building, full height windows are used throughout classrooms, staff offices, corridors, the main lobby, and the central atrium. Natural sunlight streams into the spaces, forging a sense of closeness between the indoor area and surrounding nature.

                            One of the main constraints of the old campus was space, with narrow, maze-like corridors which were hard to navigate and many small rooms.

                            At the very heart, each space also needed to tell a story. Different spaces have different purposes and much thought was given to the story that each space would tell. “For the OasISS, the space represents an ‘escape’, a space that represents growth and nurturing. Hence, a butterfly wall mural artwork was chosen for the space.
